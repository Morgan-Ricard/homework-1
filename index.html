<p>At first I was afraid, I was petrified <br>
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side <br>
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong <br>
And I grew strong<br>
And I learned how to get along<br>
And so you're back<br>
From outer space<br>
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face<br>
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key<br>
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me<br>
Go on now, go, walk out the door<br>
Just turn around now<br>
'Cause you're not welcome anymore<br>
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye<br>
Do you think I'd crumble<br>
Did you think I'd lay down and die? <br>
Oh no, not I, I will survive<br>
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive<br>
I've got all my life to live<br>
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive<br>
I will survive, hey, hey<br>

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart<br>
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart<br>
And I spent oh-so many nights just feeling sorry for myself<br>
I used to cry<br>
But now I hold my head up high and you see me<br>
Somebody new<br>
I'm not that chained-up little person and still in love with you<br>
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free<br>
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me<br>
Go on now, go, walk out the door<br>
Just turn around now<br>
'Cause you're not welcome anymore<br>
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye<br>
Do you think I'd crumble<br>
Did you think I'd lay down and die?<br>
Oh no, not I, I will survive<br>
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive<br>
I've got all my life to live<br>
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive<br>
I will survive<br>
Oh<br>
Go on now, go, walk out the door<br>
Just turn around now<br>
'Cause you're not welcome anymore<br>
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye<br>
Do you think I'd crumble<br>
Did you think I'd lay down and die?<br>
Oh no, not I, I will survive<br>
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive<br>
I've got all my life to live<br>
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive<br>
I will survive<br>
I will survive</p>
